Diameter observed at un-machined patch is between 610.09 to 610.50 mm.  2) WEP Thk. of Extension Pipe is observed as 23.13 to 24 mm.

During final machining of overlay, un-machined patch has been observed on the manually merged location.    2). Under-thickness of Extension Pipe:   Manufacturing sequence involves:  a. Set up of Extension Pipe with SON  b. Welding of Extension Pipe with SON  c. ID machining of assembly of Extension Pipe and SON.     Above stages have their inherent limitations, due to which sufficient machining allowance is required on both ID and OD of extension pipe to achieve required ID and thickness.  However, Extension Pipe is procured with finished OD (with allowance only on ID).     In KAPP/ RAPP project, Extension Pipe was procured in the form of a ring with extra material on both ID and OD as design was not finalized at that stage. This extra material on the Extension Pipe helped to achieve minimum thickness requirement  ",Others,"Preventive Action:  1. Un-machined area observed on Inconel overlay of Steam Outlet Nozzle:   For SG Tag C onward, overlay thickness shall be kept more during intermediate machining, such that if UT indication is observed, any local depression due to manual merging is removed in final machining.    L&T Proposal:  1. We propose to accept the deviation as it is, as:  In the unmachined area, the deviation of ID over 610.2 mm is observed at 3 local regions, resulting in increase in radial gap between Venturi and SON ID from 0.71 to 0.85 mm against requirement of 0.45 to 0.7 mm. The increase in radial gap by 0.01 to 0.15 mm is acceptable since it is in local region. Refer below data for details:    Location Diameter Radial gap (max.)

Some of the temporary stiffeners/beams, some of them have been attached from outside which will create hindrance for the assembly of the heater closure plates. The mapping of the additional stiffeners is as per the attached arrangement. Thus a detailed procedure for flatness correction post heater insertion along with removal sequence for temporary attachment beams before welding of closure plate needs to be added in the NCR which will be made part of the Erection procedure. Instructions for carrying out merging/ grinding and PT in the areas where the temporary stiffeners/ structurals are welded to be added in the instructions to the site.

Since there is no further correction possible and the reported flatness is the best achieved flatness, a procedure for assembly of the bellow on side plate-2 is required, which will eventually be included in site erection procedure.  Also, attached management instructions to be followed for the proper setup of the bellow with the LEN, instructions to be made for site erection and providing required support to site during site assembly.   d) For point A5, Best possible flatness is reported as per the production team and the bellow supplier and no correction is feasible.

(1) ISR(Internal support rings) elevations are Out-off tolerance:  a) Elevations of some ISRs from 'bottom tangent line-BTL' are found to be out of tolerance limit at some orientations.   b) Distance between 2 consecutive ISR i.e., 700 mm distance is found to be out of tolerance limit at some orientations.   c) The perpendicularity/tilt of all ISRs to be checked using appropriate template at 36 orientations & report.   d) Considering the column diameter of 10900mm, ISRs elevations must be measured at multiple orientations (to ensure the water level) from 'bottom tangent line-BTL'. However, as per 'section wise internal inspection reports' elevations are checked at one orientation only.  e) As per specification, ISRs elevations are to be measured using 'Spring loaded Measuring Tape' for better accuracy; 'considering a very close tolerances of +/-3mm'. However, actual measurement has been done with 'simple measuring tape' which has resulted in out-off tolerance readings.
